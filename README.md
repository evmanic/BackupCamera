evmanic backup camera example

This is an initial draft of a car backup app based heavily on Google's Camera2Basic.

This app is built using Android Studio to be loaded onto a Raspberry Pi 4 running LineageOS to use as a DIY backup system.

This is only rough code that needs to be updated to match cameras used, etc.  I plan on updating for my car's camera, etc when I get to implementing it.

I'm open to others contributing, but I'm new to GitHub, so please be patient with me!
